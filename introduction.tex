% TODO: Include a second citation. Include \eg \ie examples. Include references. Include em dash.
Here is the introduction. My dissertation introduces \emph{widgets}. If I wish
to cite someone, I could refer to them in text as in \citet{zongker2006chicken},
or parenthetically \citep{zongker2006chicken}. I can also cite just the
year \citeyearpar{zongker2006chicken} or mention the author,
\citeauthor{zongker2006chicken}.

I can use macros (\eg, the ones defined in \texttt{kyle.sty}). \Ie, just like
I am doing in the source.

Here is a section on stuff.

\subsection{Artificial Neural Networks}
\label{sec:neuralnet}

See Figure \ref{fig:neuralnet} for a neural network.

Cool.
